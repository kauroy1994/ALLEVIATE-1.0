Nine years ago I was diagnosed with depression and generalised anxiety disorder, Six years later I was also diagnosed with PTSD due to sexual assault trauma, and finally stopped living in denial and got a formal diagnosis plus started treatment for anorexia nervosa. my life\u2019s kinda been a train wreck for the most part. I always remember being deeply sad with an overly critical and hateful view of the world around me (human kind are doing nothing productive for the earth and it would be best if we walked hand in hand to extinction to save the planet kind of hateful) or for some periods of time feeling like I\u2019m buzzing with happiness, in which times I felt unstoppable. With my first diagnosis, my first set of meds followed, I trialled quite a few over the years but when I decided they didn\u2019t work for me I tried self medicating with anything I could get my hands on and ended up with major substance abuse issues. I\u2019ve now just managed to get myself sober and maintain it for the last month.\nI feel as if I\u2019m being sucked into a giant pit of despair I can\u2019t get myself out of and It\u2019s progressively getting harder to leave bed. \nI get panic attacks before and during leaving the house because I\u2019m terrified someone\u2019s going to hurt me. I only go out to get groceries and even then sometimes I get there, panic and can\u2019t leave the car so I just go home. \nI can\u2019t sleep properly anymore due to horrible nightmares. I can never shake the feeling that I\u2019m a giant burden to everyone in my life so I can\u2019t talk to them about when I\u2019m struggling. I\u2019ve isolated myself so much over the past few years I don\u2019t have a single friend left. \nI\u2019d like to try medication again but I\u2019m too terrified to try anything and have panic attacks thinking about taking something to shut up my mind in fear of getting addicted and out of control. Has anyone else struggled with this? What helped you overcome it?
