When I was in high school a few years back, I was one of the highest competitors in my school. I joined the high school band in freshman year and by senior year I became one of the best in my section. My academics were always straight and I exercised daily. Senior year I enlisted in the military and now I believe it was one of my worst decisions in life. Before I went to boot camp I was motivated, a patriot and believed that the elite joined the military. In senior year I never applied for any scholarships and I was offered one but turned it down because I already signed the papers. I thought I set myself up for success. Now I believe I was dead wrong for joining. The only benefit I see so far after a year and a half of service is that I\'m trying to set myself up financially before I get out and hopefully attend college. It sounds like a plan but I feel no happiness from what I do at all. I convinced myself there\'s no honor in it anymore, it\'s just another job. I don\'t exercise by myself anymore. I feel like I\'m not progressing anywhere in life being in service. I\'m just a body and if I wasn\'t here doing what I\'m doing, there\'d just be somebody else doing the exact same. I\'m replaceable. That\'s the mindset the military gave me. I look forward to going back home in 6 months for vacation and that\'s the only thing I\'ve been looking forward to since I\'ve been stationed. After that, the only thing I have my eyes on are getting out of service, going home, being closer to my family again. There\'s nothing here that satisfies me and I hate it. I feel like I\'ve tried everything to be happy here but it seems impossible. I wish somebody could help.
